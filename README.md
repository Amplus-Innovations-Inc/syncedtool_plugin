### Layout

On the right are options for notifying users that files have been shared. There are also options for selecting file permissions.

The share button and progress bar/feedback area is located on the bottom.

2. Upload link csv containing the links to be shared. Upload the email csv containing the emails.
3. Select the sharing options
4. Press **Share**

### Limitations and Best Practices

1. If an email in the CSV file does not have a associated Syncedtool Account, it is strongly reccomended to create one before proceeding with sharing. Not doing so may result in unexpected behaviour.

2. Ensure there are no spaces in cells.

3. If Error sharing occurs, either there is no internet, there is an issue with one or more links in the link csv, or you are not logged into the Syncedtool account.
