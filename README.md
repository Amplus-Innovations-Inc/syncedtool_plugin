# syncedtool_plugin

## Introduction

This plugin assists users in sharing files in bulk on Syncedtool through uploading CSV files.

## How to add extension

Download the ZIP, then extract the file

On you browser, go to settings and click extensions, make sure developer mode is turned on.

On the extensions page, clicked on load unpacked. Then select the folder that you extracted above.

## How to use

### Layout

On the left side are two buttons used to upload the link and email csv files, respectively.

On the right are options for notifying users that files have been shared. There are also options for selecting file permissions.

The share button and progress bar/feedback area is located on the bottom.

### How to use

Both, email and link csv files must be uploaded for the share button to work. An orange button means that the button can be pressed, when the button turns grey it is no longer avaliable.

### Limitations and Best Practices

1. If a guest account has not been made for a email in the CSV file, it is strongly reccomended to make one for the email before using this extension. Not doing so may result in unexpected behaviour.
